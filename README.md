# Bankruptcy-prediction-using-financial-ratios
Bankruptcy of Indian firms is predicted using machine learning models based on firm's finacial metrics.

These models uses four variants analyse and predict bankruptcy as follows:
(a) Altman’s 5 variables (liquidity (X1), profitability (X2), productivity (X3), leverage (X4), and asset turnover (X5)) 
(b) Carton & Hofer’s variables which uses Altman’s variables along with 6 other variables (growth of assets (GA), growth in sales (GS), growth in the number of employees (GE), operational margin (OM), change in return on equity (CROE), and change in price-to-book ratio (CPB)). 
(c) Carton & Hofer’s 11 variables along with 8 new variables Return on Equity (ROE), Return on assets (ROA), CURRENT_RATIO, QUICK_RATIO, CASHTOCURRENTASSETS, Earnings Per Share (EPS), Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), Price to Earnings ratio (PE)[3][4].
(d) Finally, 5 out of 8 new variables (ROA, ROE,  CURRENT_RATIO, QUICK_RATIO, CASHTOCURRENTASSETS) which are relatively important are considered to build the model along with Carton & Hofer’s 11 variables.

It is a comprehensive study, which involving comparison of predictive power of both 
traditional statistical techniques such as Multivariate Discriminate analysis and Logistic Regression; 
artificial intelligence models such as Artificial Neural Networks 
along with machine learning algorithms like bagging, boosting, support vector machines(linear & radial) and random forest.
